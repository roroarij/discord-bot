Several things. First,  we intend to have sufficient liquidity to minimize volatility and erratic price movements at launch .

Less than 7% of the total supply will be held by the team. Liquidity will be locked via a 3 key multi-sig, with myself, another mod, and a third party chosen by the community. We are also implementing anti-whale features that limit buy sizes on a rolling time period. Lp is also denominated in dai and mim, so tvl isn\u2019t beholden to the price of avax, which has dumped in the past, for instance, when the aavax tokens  of early investors unlocks; another unlock is happening in March . \n\n\nOther node projects also aren\u2019t transparent with treasury investment or invest in other nodes, which is probably not the most sustainable strategy. We intend to minimize risk by diversifying treasury investments to becoming validator for blue chip projects such as ftm, avax, and solana, as well as well-established yield protocols like Olympus . Another potential idea is to become a source of capital for new projects; like a launchpad almost, but with no minimum requirements and where returns to get fully distributed to community stakers/ node holders. \n\nThe issue with other node projects that were solving is that users can stake and unstable fractional nodes in community node pools at any time. Meaning they have no incentive to dump their entire holdings.

One thing that stuck out to me was the fact that rewards are denominated in the native protocol token, -i.e strong, LVT, ring -even though the treasury investments are in other protocols and (in some cases) validator nodes. To me, this seems to be the primary cause of selling pressure. Since in order for people to take profit, they must sell the rewards they are receiving, which is the native token. This puts massive sell pressure on the protocol token. I.e LVT holders recieve lvt as a reward, and therefore must sell lvt to take profit, bringing down its price. In my mind, this is what is mainly responsible for the downward price pressure on node projects. What if instead of of distributing rewards in our native protocol token, we distributed them in the form of the actual tokens we invested in. For example, if the treasury invested in solana and avax nodes and yield protocols such as olympus, lava holders would recieve rewards in the form of avax and sol and ohm. This way there wouldn't be any sell pressure on lava, as people would be selling other tokens to take profit.

For example an avax validator node will always return around 10-11% apy in the form of avax(not usd).   So even if avax price in usd decreases, the  index component of returns for that particular asset -avax -  would be the same .

I'm looking to ensure our launch is as smooth as possible and that our project remains sustainable and autonomous.

First,  we intend to have sufficient liquidity to minimize volatility and erratic price movements at launch . Second, there will be a short vesting period that occurs for those who participate in the presale, minimizing the post-launch dump other projects have seen. Less than 7% of the total supply will be held by the team. Liquidity will be locked via a 3 key multi-sig, with myself, another mod, and a third party chosen by the community. We are also implementing anti-whale features that limit buy sizes on a rolling time period. Lp is also denominated in dai and mim, so tvl isn\u2019t beholden to the price of avax, which has dumped in the past, for instance, when the aavax tokens  of early investors unlocks; another unlock is happening in March . \n\n\nOther node projects also aren\u2019t transparent with treasury investment or invest in other nodes, which is probably not the most sustainable strategy. We intend to minimize risk by diversifying treasury investments to becoming validator for blue chip projects such as ftm, avax, and solana, as well as well-established yield protocols like Olympus . Another potential idea is to become a source of capital for new projects; like a launchpad almost, but with no minimum requirements and where returns to get fully distributed to community stakers/ node holders. \n\nThe issue with other node projects that were solving is that users can stake and unstable fractional nodes in community node pools at any time. Meaning they have no incentive to dump their entire holdings. Since with other node projects you\u2019re forced to buy an entire node which you can\u2019t sell, so the only way to take profit is to sell all the rewards made off nodes.", "Basically yeh now the bubble has burst any new Doa or Naas just drops in value shortly after release making it a bit of both doesn't really do anything to solve the issue.\nSo Im just asking if there doing anything differently."], ["Not a fork but a hybrid Node-as-a-Service on AVAX with the protocol owned liquidity dynamics of OHM .

Have you compared it across multiple node forks or just this one?", "I have tested this on the contract myself"], ["I had another thought recently when analyzing the recent price action of other node projects. One thing that stuck out to me was the fact that rewards are denominated in the native protocol token, -i.e strong, LVT, ring -even though the treasury investments are in other protocols and (in some cases) validator nodes. To me, this seems to be the primary cause of selling pressure. Since in order for people to take profit, they must sell the rewards they are receiving, which is the native token. This puts massive sell pressure on the protocol token. I.e LVT holders recieve lvt as a reward, and therefore must sell lvt to take profit, bringing down its price. In my mind, this is what is mainly responsible for the downward price pressure on node projects. What if instead of of distributing rewards in our native protocol token, we distributed them in the form of the actual tokens we invested in. For example, if the treasury invested in solana and avax nodes and yield protocols such as olympus, lava holders would recieve rewards in the form of avax and sol and ohm. This way there wouldn't be any sell pressure on lava, as people would be selling other tokens to take profit. I'm still working out the mechanics of this but i think it could be great for solidifying Lava's value proposition.", ["None", "None"]], ["Currently with node forks there is very little transparency into the treasury investments and its near impossible to \"follow the money:\" and see what yield protocols the treasury is invested in and in what amounts.
